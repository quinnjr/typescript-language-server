# Branch Scope Policy

**Always create a new feature branch when work diverges from the current branch's original purpose.**

## Rule

If asked to perform work that is NOT directly related to the current branch's stated purpose:

1. **Stop and acknowledge** the scope change
2. **Create a new feature branch** from `develop` (or appropriate base)
3. **Continue work** on the new branch

## Examples

### Current branch: `feature/add-completions`

✅ **In scope** (continue on current branch):
- Adding completion triggers
- Fixing completion bugs
- Adding completion tests

❌ **Out of scope** (create new branch):
- Fixing unrelated clippy warnings → `feature/fix-clippy-warnings`
- Adding new LSP feature → `feature/add-hover-info`
- Updating CI configuration → `chore/update-ci`
- Fixing unrelated bug → `bugfix/fix-parser-crash`

### Workflow

```bash
# When out-of-scope work is needed:

# 1. Commit or stash current work
git stash  # or git commit

# 2. Switch to develop
git checkout develop

# 3. Create new branch with appropriate prefix
git checkout -b feature/new-task-description
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
# or
git checkout -b chore/maintenance-task

# 4. Do the work

# 5. Return to original branch if needed
git checkout feature/original-branch
git stash pop  # if stashed
```

## Branch Prefixes

| Prefix | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `feature/` | New functionality |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fixes |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fixes |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, deps, config |
| `docs/` | Documentation only |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring |
| `test/` | Test additions/fixes |

## Rationale

- Keeps PRs focused and reviewable
- Maintains clear git history
- Enables parallel work streams
- Follows git-flow methodology
- Makes reverting changes easier
